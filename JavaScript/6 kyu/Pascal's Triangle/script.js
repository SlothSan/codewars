/*
In mathematics, Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients expressed with formula
â€‹
 
where n denotes a row of the triangle, and k is a position of a term in the row.

Pascal's Triangle

You can read Wikipedia article on Pascal's Triangle for more information.

Task
Write a function that, given a depth n, returns n top rows of Pascal's Triangle flattened into a one-dimensional list/array.

Example:
n = 1: [1]
n = 2: [1,  1, 1]
n = 4: [1,  1, 1,  1, 2, 1,  1, 3, 3, 1]
Note
Beware of overflow. Requested terms of a triangle are guaranteed to fit into the returned type, but depending on seleced method of calculations, intermediate values can be larger.
