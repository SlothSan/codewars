Scenario
the rhythm of beautiful musical notes is drawing a Pendulum

Beautiful musical notes are the Numbers

Task
Given an array/list [] of n integers , Arrange them in a way similar to the to-and-fro movement of a Pendulum

The Smallest element of the list of integers , must come in center position of array/list.

The Higher than smallest , goes to the right .
The Next higher number goes to the left of minimum number and So on , in a to-and-fro manner similar to that of a Pendulum.

!alt
Notes
Array/list size is at least 3 .

In Even array size , The minimum element should be moved to (n-1)/2 index (considering that indexes start from 0)

Repetition of numbers in the array/list could occur , So (duplications are included when Arranging).

Input >> Output Examples:
pendulum ([6, 6, 8 ,5 ,10]) ==> [10, 6, 5, 6, 8]
Explanation:
Since , 5 is the The Smallest element of the list of integers , came in The center position of array/list

The Higher than smallest is 6 goes to the right of 5 .

The Next higher number goes to the left of minimum number and So on .

Remember , Duplications are included when Arranging , Don't Delete Them .

pendulum ([-9, -2, -10, -6]) ==> [-6, -10, -9, -2]
Explanation:
Since , -10 is the The Smallest element of the list of integers , came in The center position of array/list

The Higher than smallest is -9 goes to the right of it .

The Next higher number goes to the left of -10 , and So on .

Remeber , In Even array size , The minimum element moved to (n-1)/2 index (considering that indexes start from 0) .

pendulum ([11, -16, -18, 13, -11, -12, 3, 18]) ==> [13, 3, -12, -18, -16, -11, 11, 18]
Explanation:
Since , -18 is the The Smallest element of the list of integers , came in The center position of array/list

The Higher than smallest is -16 goes to the right of it .

The Next higher number goes to the left of -18 , and So on .

Remember , In Even array size , The minimum element moved to (n-1)/2 index (considering that indexes start from 0) .
