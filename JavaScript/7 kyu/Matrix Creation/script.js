Create an identity matrix of the specified size( >= 0).

Some examples:

(1)  =>  [[1]]

(2) => [ [1,0],
         [0,1] ]

       [ [1,0,0,0,0],
         [0,1,0,0,0],
(5) =>   [0,0,1,0,0],
         [0,0,0,1,0],
         [0,0,0,0,1] ]   

*/

const getMatrix = (number) => {
  let result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < number; i++) {
    result[i] = Array(number).fill(0);
    result[i][i] = 1;
  }
  return result;
};

console.log(getMatrix(4));
//[ [ 1, 0, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 1, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 1, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 0, 1 ] ]
