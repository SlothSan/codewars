/*
Write a function called sumIntervals/sum_intervals that accepts an array of intervals, and returns the sum of all the interval lengths. Overlapping intervals should only be counted once.

Intervals
Intervals are represented by a pair of integers in the form of an array. The first value of the interval will always be less than the second value. Interval example: [1, 5] is an interval from 1 to 5. The length of this interval is 4.

Overlapping Intervals
List containing overlapping intervals:

[
   [1, 4],
   [7, 10],
   [3, 5]
]
The sum of the lengths of these intervals is 7. Since [1, 4] and [3, 5] overlap, we can treat the interval as [1, 5], which has a length of 4.

Examples:
sumIntervals( [
   [1, 2],
   [6, 10],
   [11, 15]
] ) => 9

sumIntervals( [
   [1, 4],
   [7, 10],
   [3, 5]
] ) => 7

sumIntervals( [
   [1, 5],
   [10, 20],
   [1, 6],
   [16, 19],
   [5, 11]
] ) => 19

sumIntervals( [
   [0, 20],
   [-100000000, 10],
   [30, 40]
] ) => 100000030
Tests with large intervals
Your algorithm should be able to handle large intervals. All tested intervals are subsets of the range [-1000000000, 1000000000].

const sumIntervals = (intervals) => {
  intervals = intervals.sort(function (a, b) {
    return a[0] - b[0];
  });
  intervals = intervals.reduce(function (acc, el, index, array) {
    const anterior = array[index - 1];
    if (array.length > 1 && anterior !== undefined) {
      if (el[0] < acc[acc.length - 1]) {
        if (el[1] >= acc[acc.length - 1]) {
          acc[acc.length - 1] = el[1];
        }
      } else {
        acc.push(...el);
      }
    } else {
      acc.push(...el);
    }
    return acc;
  }, []);
  let result = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < intervals.length - 1; i += 2) {
    result += intervals[i + 1] - intervals[i];
  }
  return result;
};
